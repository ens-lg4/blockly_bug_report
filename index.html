        The rules are defined as follows:
        <ul>
        <li>Green can be followed by Blue</li>
        <li>Green can be followed by Purple</li>
        <li>Blue can be followed by Green</li>
        </ul>
        However if you first make a Green-Purple pair, then fit a Blue between them, it will unfortunately bind (so only one of the rules is checked at this point, it seems).
        You can then drag the Blue block bound to the Purple one. Now you have an "illegal" Blue-Purple pair - something you would not be able to construct directly.
